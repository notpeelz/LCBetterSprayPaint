## Features & Usage
NOTE: All players must have the same version of the mod installed, or spraypaint won't sync properly between players.

- Spraypaint never runs out (can be toggled in config by lobby host)
- Increased range
- Shaking the can is more effective
- Several changes/bugfixes that make spraypaint work more consistently, look better, and feel better to use
	- Certain spots in levels may still be unpaintable (due to invisible colliders). It remains to be seen if this can be fixed in the future.
- You can now erase! Hold "item tertiary use" (default: E) while spraying to erase instead. (can be toggled in config by lobby host)
- Reduced sound effect volume (configurable)
