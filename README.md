# Features & Usage
NOTE: All players must have the same version of the mod installed to play together.

## Improved painting & eraser
- Several changes/bugfixes that make spraypaint work more consistently, look better, and feel better to use
	- Certain spots in levels may still be unpaintable (due to invisible colliders). It remains to be seen if this can be fixed in the future.
- You can now erase! (By default: press `E` + `LMB` at the same time)  
  (can be disabled in config by lobby host)

## Color control
Colors sync properly, and players can **change** the color of their spray paint! (default key: `T`)  
(can be disabled by lobby host)

(maximum size can be configured by lobby host)
